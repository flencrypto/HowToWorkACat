# How to Work a Cat 🐱

A playful, UK-toned, offline-first kitten-care guide for first-time kitten owners, families, and temporary fosterers.

## Overview

**How to Work a Cat** is a reassuring, lightly sarcastic guide explaining real kitten needs via analogies, metaphors, and human comparisons. Think: "keep the litter tray like a shared bathroom you'd happily eat toast in" or "you're not a 24/7 chew-toy subscription service".

- 📚 **Kitten Ops Manual**: Step-by-step onboarding checklist for your first 10 steps
- 🎨 **Diagram Pack**: Visual guides for safe room setup, body language, poison risks
- 🆘 **Panic Buttons**: Quick access to "Not eating", "Litter disasters", "Scratching sofa", etc.
- 💾 **Offline-first**: All content bundled and searchable without internet
